# Roman to Integer Converter

- I found this problem set on Leet Code and have been wanting to give this a shot in `Java` Programming Language.
- Have to say it was a little challenging but I think I did it.
- I ran some tests and the results are promising. Lets hope it does not break...
- I have added the option to manually give input from set function or you can also call take function that basically takes input on the runtime.
  `NOTE: Make sure to enter values only in Caps`
  I was too lazy to remove the caps check :p
